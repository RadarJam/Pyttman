    Ability
        Chatbots can have many areas of capabilities; Anything from answering questions, searching the web, playing songs to playing games.
        I call these *Abilities*.

    Intent
        The *Intent* class is the heart of the Pyttman development experience.
        They are classes, 1:1 to a message and a response.

    Entity
        In Pyttman, the Entity is a word, or several words sought in a message. When writing chatbots it's very common to have to parse the message from humans to try and find words of interest.
